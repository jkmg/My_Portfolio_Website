# [Project 1: Create app with streamlit to predict the type of iris plant](https://github.com/jkmg/Iris)
* In this project, I used **streamlit** to create a website app that predicts the type of iris plant ('Iris-setosa', 'Iris-versicolor' and 'Iris-virginica') from the paramters sepal length, sepal width and petal width in cm.

# [Project 2: Build a classification model to predict the probability of heart failure](https://github.com/jkmg/Heart_Disease_Prediction)
* In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis on a dataset used for heart failure prediction, built several classification models to predict the probability of heart failure and compared performance between them.
